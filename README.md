## 🌟 About the Project

This repository serves as the source code for my professional portfolio website, designed to showcase my foundational skills in web development. The site is engineered with a strong emphasis on **performance**, **accessibility**, and **clean code structure**.

It is the primary platform for recruiters and potential collaborators to review my work and technical approach.

## 💡 Key Features Highlight

| **🎨 Fully Responsive UI** | Ensures a flawless experience across all devices, from mobile phones to high-resolution desktops. |
| **🌓 Theme Toggle** | Integrated Dark/Light Mode switch for enhanced user comfort and preference. |
| **✉️ Contact Form (Mock)** | A placeholder form demonstrating structure. **Note:** Currently using a mock submission handler in JS, requires a backend service (like Formspree) for real message delivery. |
| **📈 Scroll Animations** | Implements subtle JavaScript animations to improve user engagement and modern aesthetics. |
| **🧱 Pure Tech Stack** | Built exclusively using Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—demonstrating core competence without heavy frameworks. |
